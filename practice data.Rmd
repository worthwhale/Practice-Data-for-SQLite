library(DBI) #DBI stands for "database interface" and creates a connection between R and other database management systems


animals <- read_csv("random data.csv") #read in a fake dataset that I created in excel, just so I could practice trying to connect this dataset to DB Browser for sqlite

filename <- "db.sqlite"
mydb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), filename)
dbWriteTable(mydb,"animals", animals) # I think the reason why I get an error on this line when I try to run it, is because the table has already been created in sqlite, so it must've worked the first time.

#dbDisconnect(mydb)
#unlink(filename)

# I then loaded the RSQLite package in the console, which allowed line 21 of code to work. I had to restart R and use "install.packages" in the console before re-loading the DBI library.
